    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Bhagat Singh was one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement.
      Known for his courage, patriotism, and his belief in social justice, he inspired generations to fight 
      for freedom from British colonial rule. His execution at the age of 23 made him a national hero and 
      a symbol of fearless resistance against oppression.
